## Features

- **Title Screen** with start button and mute instructions
- **Mute Button**: Press `M` during gameplay to mute/unmute sounds
- **15 Unique Levels**: Selectable via keyboard or mouse, each with a preview image
- **Game Over & Win Screens**: Custom backgrounds, restart instructions, and fireworks on win
- **Multiple Power-ups**: Includes Grow Paddle, Laser, Glue, Slow Ball, Multi-ball, Extra Life, and Shrink Paddle
- **Particle Effects**: For brick breaking, paddle/ball collisions, and fireworks
- **Laser Cannons**: Shoot bricks when powered up
- **Responsive Controls** and smooth gameplay
- **Textured Graphics**: High-quality textures for bricks, paddle, and game elements

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Folder Structure

```
pygame-arkanoid/
  assets/
    images/
      graphics/         # Game graphics (bricks, paddle, edges, icons, etc.)
      levels/           # Level preview images (level_1.png ... level_15.png)
    sounds/             # Game sound effects and music
  src/
    __init__.py
    main.py             # Main game entry point
    game_objects.py     # Game object classes (Paddle, Ball, Brick, etc.)
  requirements.txt
  README.md
```

- **All images and sounds are in the `assets/` folder.**
- **All source code is in the `src/` folder.**

## How to Run

1. **Make sure you have installed the requirements above**
2. **Run the game from the `src/` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
   ```
   (This ensures asset paths work correctly.)

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move paddle left/right
- **Space**: Launch ball (when glued) or start game/return to title
- **M**: Mute/unmute sounds
- **F**: Fire lasers (when laser power-up is active)
- **Mouse**: Click level preview to select level in level select screen
- **1-9, 0**: Select level by number in level select screen
- **P**: Pause/unpause the game (shows 'PAUSED')

## Power-ups

- **Grow (G)**: Paddle grows larger
- **Laser (L)**: Enables laser cannons (press F to fire)
- **Glue (C)**: Ball sticks to paddle on hit
- **Slow (S)**: Ball moves slower
- **Multi (M)**: Splits ball into two
- **Life (+)**: Gain an extra life
- **Shrink (-)**: Paddle shrinks

## Assets

- All images and sounds are included in the `assets/` folder.
- Make sure the `assets/` folder is in the project root (at the same level as `src/`).
- Do **not** move the assets folder or the game may not find the images/sounds.
